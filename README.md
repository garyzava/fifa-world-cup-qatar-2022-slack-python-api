# fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-slack-python-api
 Python script that reads data from the FIFA's API for World Cup Qatar 2022, then post the data on a slack channel through a slack bot (slack app).

 ## Disclaimer
 Use it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script. The script assumes that the FIFA API uses the UTC+0 timezone, gmtime() function is used to convert the date to UTC+0 timezone.
